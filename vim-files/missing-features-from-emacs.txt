This file contains a small list with all the features I currently have in Emacs,
that Vim doesn't have.

Missing Features:

 ** Multiple Cursors on Separate Lines
  - Narrow View to a Specific Region in a File
  * A Git Version Control System (Emacs Has Magit)
*** A Decent File Browser (Emacs has Dired)
  - A Decent Code Browser (Emacs has Etags and Xref)
  - Some Emacs Themes are too good to not have in Vim
  - A Good Integrated Terminal (Emacs has Term)

* Vim currently has FuGitive, but it feels odd and like missing something when
  compared to Emacs' Magit.

** This one is pending because I found two good ones... but with a caveat:
    * One is for Vim, and the other is for Neovim.
    * The Vim one is not much maintained anymore but it fits both.
    * The Neovim one is actively maintained but it only fits Neovim.

*** There are basically no big file browsers for Vim outside of NERDTree and the
    default Netrw, which happens to be quite buggy :(
    For Neovim, however, there is nvim-tree.lua, which is actively maintained and
    is like some sort of combination between Treemacs and Dired in Emacs. This one
    might be the one that will push me to move to Neovim :/

Complete:

- Open Files/Buffers Manager (Got Buffer Tree Explorer for Vim)
