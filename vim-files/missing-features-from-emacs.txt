This file contains a small list with all the features I currently have in Emacs,
that Vim doesn't have.

Missing Features:

- Multiple Cursors on Separate Lines
- Open Files/Buffers Manager (Emacs has IBuffer)
- Narrow View to a Specific Region in a File
- A Git Version Control System* (Emacs Has Magit)
- A Decent File Browser (Emacs has Dired)
- A Decent Code Browser (Emacs has Etags and Xref)
- Some Emacs Themes are too good to not have in Vim
- A Good Integrated Terminal (Emacs has Term)

* Vim currently has FuGitive, but it feels odd and like missing something when
  compared to Emacs' Magit.
