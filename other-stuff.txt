Important Ideas to Implement:
  - Install Powerline fonts before anything Vim and Tmux related at least.
  - Install and configure the necessary libs for Clang Complete and Omnisharp.
      (This one might be more complicated than it sounds, so we won't treat it
       as urgent.)

All:
  - Bash
  - Vim
  - Emacs
  - Tmux
  - Neovim (Optional)

MacOS:
  - Brew
  - Linux GNU Tools (e.g. ls, grep)
  - VimR (Optional)

Linux:
  - Neovim-qt (Optional)
