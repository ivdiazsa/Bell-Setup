This file contains a small list with all the features I currently have in Emacs,
that Vim doesn't have.

Missing Features:

 ** Multiple Cursors on Separate Lines
  * A Git Version Control System (Emacs Has Magit)
  $ A Decent Code Browser (Emacs has Etags and Xref)
  - Some Emacs Themes are too good to not have in Vim
 && A Good Integrated Terminal (Emacs has Term)
  & Multiple Frames/Windows with the same files open (Emacs has this natively)

* Vim currently has FuGitive, but it feels odd and like missing something when
  compared to Emacs' Magit. Might end up trying out Neogit for Neovim instead...

** This one is pending because I found two good ones... but with a caveat:
    * One is for Vim, and the other is for Neovim.
    * The Vim one is not much maintained anymore but it fits both.
    * The Neovim one is actively maintained but it only fits Neovim.

& Seems like Vim/Neovim are really against this concept :/

&& We might have to deal with Vim's terminal. Hoping Neovim's is less buggy.

$ Going to try CTags and Vim's native support.

- This will happen gradually, porting those themes to Vim.

Complete:

- Open Files/Buffers Manager (Got Buffer Tree Explorer for Vim)
- Narrow View to a Specific Region in a File (Got NrrwRgn for Vim)
- A Decent File Browser (Got Nvim-Tree for Neovim)
