This file contains a small list with all the features I currently have in Emacs,
that Vim doesn't have.

Missing Features:

  $ A Decent Code Browser (Emacs has Etags and Xref)
  - Some Emacs Themes are too good to not have in Vim
  & Multiple Frames/Windows with the same files open (Emacs has this natively)

* Vim currently has FuGitive, but it feels odd and like missing something when
  compared to Emacs' Magit. Might end up trying out Neogit for Neovim instead...

& Seems like Vim/Neovim are really against this concept :/

$ Going to try CTags and Vim's native support.

- This will happen gradually, porting those themes to Vim.

Complete:

- Open Files/Buffers Manager (Got Buffer Tree Explorer for Vim)
- Narrow View to a Specific Region in a File (Got NrrwRgn for Vim)
- A Decent File Browser (Got Nvim-Tree for Neovim)
- Multiple Cursors on Separate Lines (Got Vim-Visual-Multi for Vim)
- A Git Version Control System (Got Neogit for Neovim but need to configure the diff tool)
- A Good Integrated Terminal (Neovim's Terminal seems to be stable enough)
